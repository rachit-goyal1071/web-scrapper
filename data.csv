In both cases, the overall structure follows Hindi, whereas English vocabulary such as time, staircase, and smelly, appears.(1) Kitna time lagega?‘What time is it?’(2) Ye staircase bahut smelly he!‘This staircase is very smelly’This natural mixture of two linguistic components has been viewed as creating ‘a third space (Bhatt 2008)’ and a ‘translingual turn (García & Li, 2014)’ in linguistics. Especially, the mixed code of English and Indian languages, or “Inglish”, is a common phenomenon across India.This phenomenon has raised interest in (i) the cognitive processing of multiple languages during code-mixing and even asked a fundamental question about the reality of language.

IP0SS0200004,Phase-field modelling of structural slabs,"Slabs are a commonly observed structure in a variety of applications, e.g., roads, buildings, airports, ports, etc. Slabs fail when they develop cracks in them, which indicates a decrease in structural capacity. Typically, slabs are analyzed using elastic theory, either through analytical models or numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, this approach is unable to capture the development of cracks or decrease in structural capacity. Phase field modelling is a promising approach to fill this gap, which involves modelling a damage parameter to account for decrease in structural capacity. The damage parameter itself then becomes a proxy for the development of a crack. This project aims to model structural slabs using phase-field modelling on the open-source FEM platform CalculiX.
