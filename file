The development of machine learning-based techniques for designing organic fluorescent materials is technologically appealing due to the issue of accurately forecasting emission properties. This project aims to introduce a graph neural network-based approach for rationally designing fluorescent molecules with pre-defined physical properties. The algorithm will employ molecular SMILES as the input, where the string information will be encoded and decoded to understand the relation between molecular network structure and subsequent physical properties. In the next stage, a generative network will be applied to the latent space with a generator to generate samples to mimic the latent space and a discriminator to distinguish models from the latent space. Finally, screening the generated samples will yield potential model compounds enriching the fluorescent library.

Due to the complex nature of organic material compatibility and properties, such as energy-level alignment and maximizing absorption spectra, and the vastness of chemical space, computational guidance is vital to the experimental counterpart. This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict device efficiency based on an existing database. In the next step, genetic algorithms (GA) will be employed to discover high-performing donors and acceptors and their combinations for potential high-efficiency solar cells. The central goal here is to develop a GA-based model for the selection of tandem cell materials successfully and find material combinations that, when in a device together, have strong absorption across the entire visible-near-IR spectrum.

Optimizing classical force field parameters, especially non-bonded interaction parameters represented by the Lennard-Jones potential, is challenging. Over the years, it has been manual approaches that have yielded these parameters. Although such parameters produce correct descriptions (within a limit of accuracy) of physical properties at a given set of state points, they suffer from transferability, and the overall parameter generation process needs a streamlined workflow. Data-driven parameterization of Lennard-Jones potential could address these challenges. This project aims to employ Gaussian Process Regression coupled with Genetic Algorithm for such an optimization problem.

Code-mixing, or code-switching, exemplified in (1) and (2), occurs when an utterance contains more than one “code”, or a linguistic variety (such as languages and dialects). Sentences (1) and (2) are the cases of Hindi-English code-switching. In both cases, the overall structure follows Hindi, whereas English vocabulary such as time, staircase, and smelly, appears.<br>
<br>
(1) Kitna time lagega? <br>
‘What time is it?’<br>
(2) Ye staircase bahut smelly he! <br>
‘This staircase is very smelly’<br>
<br>
This natural mixture of two linguistic components has been viewed as creating ‘a third space (Bhatt 2008)’ and a ‘translingual turn (García &amp; Li, 2014)’ in linguistics. Especially, the mixed code of English and Indian languages, or “Inglish”, is a common phenomenon across India. <br>
 <br>
This phenomenon has raised interest in (i) the cognitive processing of multiple languages during code-mixing and even asked a fundamental question about the reality of language. The proposed summer project (2024) focuses on the levels, aspects, and depth of multilingualism practiced by Indian youth in virtual spaces such as social media and blogs. My current scope is on the Hindi-English situation, but there is a possible expansion to other multilingual contexts. The project will have two phases. First, data collection takes place to capture representative loanwords, borrowing, and cod-switching cases among Hindi-English bilinguals. Next, the potential separation in their cognitive perception through brain imaging under the concepts of language control and switch cost.  This research will shed light to the Hindi-English mental lexicon practiced in India.

Slabs are a commonly observed structure in a variety of applications, e.g., roads, buildings, airports, ports, etc. Slabs fail when they develop cracks in them, which indicates a decrease in structural capacity. Typically, slabs are analyzed using elastic theory, either through analytical models or numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, this approach is unable to capture the development of cracks or decrease in structural capacity. Phase field modelling is a promising approach to fill this gap, which involves modelling a damage parameter to account for decrease in structural capacity. The damage parameter itself then becomes a proxy for the development of a crack. This project aims to model structural slabs using phase-field modelling on the open-source FEM platform CalculiX.

This jumping-droplet condensation phenomenon has demonstrated improvements in heat transfer, anti-icing properties, and self-cleaning efficiency. In this project, our focus is to experimentally investigate multidroplet coalescence. We will employ high-speed imaging from side-view and top-view perspectives to analyze numerous jumping events on a copper oxide nanostructured superhydrophobic surface. Our goal is to explore the various mechanisms that lead to droplet jumping scenarios. Additionally, we will measure droplet-jumping speeds across a range of droplet radii to gain insights into the capillary-to-inertial energy conversion mechanism.

The arrival times of the seismic waves are often the most important parameters in determination of earthquake attributes like magnitude, location and focal mechanism. However, this work is often done by a single seismologist. We want to crowdsource seismic waveform picking, for which a platform like mobile app would be ideal. Crowd sourced seismic phase selection outperforms any automated picker as humans are much superior at recognising patterns and as the majority of the arrival times accessible for existing data have no uncertainty data connected with them, AI systems trained on them are only as good or poor as the few people who performed the choosing in the first place.

Exoskeletons are robotic systems that are used in parallel with a human body segment for assisting disabled individuals. In our lab, we are developing wearable robotic exoskeletons that are light-weight, flexible, and can be worn on legs, arms, or trunk. This project will involve activities, such as design and development, control, and testing, to apply controlled external forces during movement tasks, such as walking, lifting weight, drawing, etc.<br>

Deploying quadcopters for aerial transportation can be cost effective in impromptu material handling applications. However, such applications are limited mainly due to the requirement of onboard localization sensors and associated computation. This project explores different collaboration modalities, such as human-quadcopter or multiple quadcopters, to successfully execute spontaneous outdoor flight of a quadcopter with a payload. <br>
